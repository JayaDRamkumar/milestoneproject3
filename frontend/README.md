Inspiration:
- I inherited a real estate buisness in which I rent properties to many different tenants. I found it hard to advertise and show tenants houses while living a couple hours away and then vetting them and getting all their information to run a background check and decide if they are sutiable tenants. This app was build in the intentions to elivate that problems and have the tenants see the properties and input their information in a quick and seemless way. 

Technologies used to build Application
> MERN:
- MongoDB: Database
- Express: A node js web application framework that provides features to build web and mobile applications. It is used to build a single page, multipage, and hybrid web application. It's a layer built on the top of the Node js that helps manage servers and routes
- React: Front-end library for building user interfaces.
- Nodes.js: Allows Javascript to run outside a browser in places like a web server.

> Backend Dependencies
- Express
- MongoDb
- dotenv: create environment variables in a . env file instead of putting them in code.
- nodemon: command-line tool that helps with development of Node. js applications. It monitors the project directory and automatically restarts your node application when it detects any changes.

> Frontend Dependiencies:
- react-router-dom:route different urls to different pages on our site

> How to Use Application:
 - Open 2 command prompts.
- Navigate to "backend" folder and run ~nodemon start to start the backend.
- Navigate to "frontend" folder and run ~npm start to start the front end.
- Your browser will open up to your localhost and you will be brought to the homepage.

Outstanding bugs or unfinished functionality
- My application page does not have a working database in which when you apply for a house/ apartment it does not submit. I would like to implement that.
- Also I would like to implement two different portals: a tenant and owner/landlord portal in which landlords can see all applications.
